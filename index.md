Beneficial and Harms of Gene Editing
Life is limited, short and fragile. Everyone want to enjoy their life as long as possible. However, diseases have frightened many people. They put people into horrible pain, and bring them death. Among them, HIV and cancer are two of the most frightening.
Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths occurred in 2020. 690,000 people die from HIV in 2020, too. Facing these terrible diseases, there was nothing we could do that time. But now, we have something to solve the problem——       gene editing.
Our sole contention discusses how gene editing technology helps to fight against diseases in an unprecedented way. It can save many lives.
Whichever side that can save human lives best should win
Gene editing is a kind of genetic designing wherein DNA is embedded, erased, changed or supplanted in the genome of a living being. It can be used to change the DNA in cells, modify human blood cells that are then put back into the body to treat conditions including leukemia and AIDS, and could treat other infections and simple genetic conditions. This provides solutions for many unsolvable and chronic illnesses and opens up immense opportunities for the medical world. https://trybiotech.com/gene-editing-pros-and-cons/
 
In 2015, scientists successfully used somatic gene therapy when a one-year old in the United Kingdom named Layla received a gene editing treatment to help her fight leukemia, a type of cancer. These scientists tried many treatments before this, but none of them seemed to work, so scientists used a genome editing technology called TALENs. This saved Layla's life. And more cases are happening beyond this.
According to the genetic engineering and Biotechnology news, 2018, “CRISPER Eradicates Latent HIV-1, offering hope of ‘functional cures’”, HIV-1 infects about 35 million people worldwide. Still according to the same article, scientists Japan have used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to stop HIV-1 replication in latently infectd T cells that can’t be controlled using existing drug treatments. The constant drug treatments can’t control the virus, but only CRISPER can. We don’t see what’s wrong for saving 35 million people’s lives.
Gene editing technology is not allowed in China now. On March 1, 2021, the amendment to the criminal law (11) promulgated by the Chinese legislature came into effect. Article 336-1 of the criminal law stipulates that anyone who implants a gene editor into a human body or an animal, or implants a gene editor into a human body, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention and shall also be fined; If the circumstances are especially serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years and shall also be fined. This is partly because the technology is not undeveloped now, and we can also see that the technology will be strictly controlled by the government.
In the future, as the project is more developed, the potentials are invaluable. While we present a solution for these chronically ill patients, our opponents could offer nothing, making our impact unique and thus voting for Pro.
